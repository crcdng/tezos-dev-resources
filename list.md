* Octez, an implementation of the Tezos blockchain https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos
* TZIP: Tezos improvement proposals (Standards) https://gitlab.com/tezos/tzip/-/tree/master/

## Courses and Learning resources  

* Tacode offers a starter course in CameLIGO https://tacode.dev/courses/dev-starter
* The B9Lab Tezos Developer Portal https://tezos.b9lab.com/ offers a course in Tezos development covering SmartyPy, Michelson, LIGO, Taquito   
* PyTezos course https://pytezos.baking-bad.org/ running in Google Colab / Jupyter Notebooks

# 4. Tooling 

* Taqueria "Taqueria provides a seamless development workflow to easily build, test and deploy your Tezos applications." https://taqueria.io/ Taqueria provides a Command Line Interface and VSCode plugin, integrating tools such as SmartPy, Ligo, Taquito and Flextesa (a blockchain simulator). It aims to simplify setup of development tools, compilation and deployment.
**Taqueria (in beta) looks promising as an alternative to install individual tools / languages** 

# 5. Individual Programming Languages (alphabetically)

### Archetype 

* Archetype DSL: "a domain-specific language to develop Smart Contracts on the Tezos blockchain, with a specific focus on contract verification" https://archetype-lang.org/ (MIT License)

### C# 

* Netezos: "Netezos is a cross-platform Tezos SDK for .NET developers, simplifying the access and interaction with the Tezos blockchain." https://github.com/baking-bad/netezos (MIT License)

### JavaScript / Typescript

* Taquito: "A TypeScript library suite for development on the Tezos blockchain." https://tezostaquito.io/ (MIT License) **Taquito is my recommendation for connecting web apps to APIs and to smart contracts written in CamelLIGO on Tezos** 

* see also: JsLIGO, SmartPy

### Flutter and Dart 

* Tezart "A magic way to interact with the Tezos blockchain using dart." https://moneytrackio.github.io/tezart/#/ (MIT License)

### Go

* TzGo "TzGo is the officially supported Tezos Go client library by Blockwatch." In Betas. https://github.com/blockwatch-cc/tzgo (MIT License)

### Juvix 

* Juvix DSL "Juvix is a research programming language created by Heliax as a first step toward creating more robust and reliable alternatives for formally verified smart contracts than existing languages." https://juvix.org/ (GPL)

### Haskell

* Indigo / Morley / Lorentz "Indigo eDSL is a high level language for Michelson contract development. It is built on top of Lorentz, which in turn is built on top of Morley." https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/indigo https://wiki.tezosagora.org/learn/smartcontracts/morley-framework (MIT License)

### LIGO 

* "A friendly Smart Contract Language for Tezos" https://ligolang.org/. LIGO offers two languages: CameLIGO (based on OCaml) and JsLIGO (based on JavaScript). MIT License. **CameLIGO is my recommendation for blockchain coding on Tezos** 

### Michelson

* Michelson "the language of Smart Contracts in Tezos" https://tezos.gitlab.io/alpha/michelson.html (The native, low level language of Tezos, written in OCaml (https://ocaml.org/), used to write smart contracts on the Tezos blockchain, MIT License). Higher level languages such as CamelLIGO and SmartPy are compiled to Michelson.

### Python 

* PyTezos "A Python library for interacting with Tezos blockchain, testing smart contracts, and writing Michelson scripts." https://pytezos.org/ (MIT License)

* SmartPy "The SmartPy language is available through a Python library for building and analyzing Tezos smart contracts. It comes with various tools: a compiler that generates Michelson code, a simulation engine, a contract explorer, etc." https://smartpy.io/ (MIT License) SmartPy also has an online IDE so you don't have to install anything to start coding: https://smartpy.io/ide. Note that despite the name, SmartPy also offers a TypeScript implementation.
**SmartPy is my recommendation for quick experiments and introductory blockchain coding on Tezos**

# 7. Outdated / not recommended libraries and resources 

These are to best of my knowledge outdated / unmaintained (no public commits repository for at least 3 months)  

* better call dev API superseded by tzKT API (Baking Bad)

* Truffle 

* Figment Learn tutorials: https://learn.figment.io/protocols/tezos Attempts to provide a containered learning environment for multipe chains, The UX is conplicated by long loading times, pop-up messages. Confusing for beginners.

* I cannot recommend the gamified LIGO course either https://tezosacademy.io/. Although the course content is well-made, it's online editor suffers from major usabiliy issues; service worker errors go unchecked, it needs proofreading but there is not even a hint where to report errors, and I do not recommend to use phrases such as "go ahead soldier and make us proud!" in a learning resource aimed at coding education for a diverse audience.
