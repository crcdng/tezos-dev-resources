# Resources for Developers - Hic et Nunc / Teia / Tezos 

**tl;dr**

For Tezos smart contracts choose either [SmartPy](https://smartpy.io/) (beginner-friendly Python Syntax) or [CameLIGO](https://ligolang.org/?lang=cameligo) (statically typed, functional OCaml Syntax). To connect web frontends to smart contracts, use [Taquito](https://tezostaquito.io/) (TypeScript) .

There is a tutorial how to start completely from scratch that walks through the installation of all required tools here: https://github.com/crcdng/ligo_demo_contract (for now Mac only)

To try things out without installing anything, you can explore the online editors of [SmartPy](https://smartpy.io/ide) and [LIGO](https://ide.ligolang.org/).

For more information on coding for [Teia](https://teia.art/) or [Tezos](https://tezos.com/) have a look at the [list of dev resources](list.md). I try to keep it up to date. You can support this work and creative digital artwork curation by donating to tz1ffYDwFHchNy5vA5isuCAK2yVxh4Ye9pnk.
