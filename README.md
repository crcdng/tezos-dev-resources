**tl;dr**

To start learning to code smart contracts choose either: SmartPy (beginner-friendly Python Syntax) https://smartpy.io/ or CameLigo (statically typed, functional OCaml Syntax) https://ligolang.org/. 

For more resources, look at the curated [list](list.md) of [Hic et Nunc](https://www.hicetnunc.art/) dev resources.
