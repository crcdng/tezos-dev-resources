# Resources for Developers - Hic et Nunc / Teia / Tezos 

**tl;dr**

For Tezos smart contracts choose either SmartPy (beginner-friendly Python Syntax) https://smartpy.io/ or CameLIGO (statically typed, functional OCaml Syntax) https://ligolang.org/. To connect web frontends to smart contracts, use Taquito (TypeScript) https://tezostaquito.io/.

Without installing anything on your machine, you can explore SmartPy here https://smartpy.io/ide and CameLIGO here https://ide.ligolang.org/.

For more information on how to develop for [Teia](https://teia.art/) or for [Tezos](https://tezos.com/) in general, look at the curated [list of dev resources](list.md). 

I try to keep this list up to date. You can support this work and creative digital artwork curation by donating to  tz1ffYDwFHchNy5vA5isuCAK2yVxh4Ye9pnk.
