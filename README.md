**tl;dr**
To start learning to code Tezos smart contracts choose either SmartPy (beginner-friendly Python Syntax) https://smartpy.io/ or CameLIGO (statically typed, functional OCaml Syntax) https://ligolang.org/. 

Without installing anything on your machine,you can explore SmartPy here https://smartpy.io/ide and CameLIGO here https://ide.ligolang.org/, choose "Increment CameLIGO" from the left menu.

For more information on how to develop for [Teia](https://teia.art/) or [Tezos](https://tezos.com/) in general look at the curated [list of dev resources](list.md).
