# hen-dev-resources

**tl;dr**
To start learning to code smart contracts choose either: SmartPy (beginner-friendly Python Syntax) https://smartpy.io/ or CameLigo (statically typed, functional OCaml Syntax) https://ligolang.org/. 

For more information, look at the curated [list of dev resources](list.md) for [Hic et Nunc](https://www.hicetnunc.art/) and [Tezos](https://tezos.com/).
