# Resources for Developers - Hic et Nunc / Teia / Tezos 

**tl;dr**
<img width="981" alt="tezos_development" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/830492/221701284-fb6722a7-8568-4780-aaad-4211ffd771d1.png">

For Tezos smart contracts choose either [Archetype](https://archetype-lang.org/) or [CameLIGO](https://ligolang.org/?lang=cameligo). To connect web frontends to smart contracts ("dApp"), use [Taquito](https://tezostaquito.io/) (TypeScript).

There are two tutorials, one for [Archetype](https://github.com/crcdng/smart_contract_101_archetype) and one for [CameLIGO](https://github.com/crcdng/smart_contract_101_ligo) *(currently not complete / WIP)*. They cover how to install all the required tools and start completely from scratch (for now on a Mac only). 

To try things out without installing anything, you can also explore the online editors of [SmartPy](https://smartpy.io/ide) and [LIGO](https://ide.ligolang.org/).

For more information on coding for [Teia](https://teia.art/) or [Tezos](https://tezos.com/) have a look at the [list of dev resources](list.md). I try to keep it up to date. You can support this work and creative digital artwork curation by donating to tz1ffYDwFHchNy5vA5isuCAK2yVxh4Ye9pnk.
